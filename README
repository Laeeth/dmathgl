port of mathgl library to the D programming language

status - C bindings are done, although functions requiring variadic arguments with no fixed arguments have not been wrapped (dmd complains)
not tested at all beyond the first trivial example (which does compile and run)

to do
 - port tests to D.
 - get these variadic functions working too.
 -  port the C++ wrappers to D
